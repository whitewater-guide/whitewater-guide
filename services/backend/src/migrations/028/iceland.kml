Put in where the road ends.<br><br>Take out:<br>Drive past the farm Tunguháls and follow a gravel road until it ends and you make a sharp right turn following a track through a field. You know you are in the right place if you see a home made lift for rafts leading into the canyon.<br><br>Description:<br>If you are in doubt talk to the friendly guys at Arctic Rafting at Hafgrímsstaðir base camp.<br><br>This is a mostly class III river with a few big class IV rapids. The rapids have names such as Lost, Screaming Lady, and The Green Room (which is actually black). This is a long day in a gorge. All of the bigger rapids can be scouted from the bank, with some effort, and the hardest one can be portaged. This is a river of epic tales, pleasant days, and great adventures. If you plan to make the run it is easiest to join a rafting trip from Hafgrímsstaðir rafting base. Makes the logistics so much easier and you can get a hot coco and waffles in the canyon.]]></description>

Follow a dirt road through the farm land, following the river. You will need a 4 wheel drive or a small jeep to get to the put in.<br>Normally we put in at Creamy falls, which is a 3-4m waterfall in the river, but it is well possible to go higher.<br><br>Take out:<br>Just below the bridge.<br><br>Description:<br>This is one of the best runs in Iceland. Demanding and scenic. At the take out look for the water level on the down stream side of the bridge. There is a small ledge on the bridge wall, if the water level is around the ledge, +- 10 cm, there should be good conditions to run the river. If the water is much higher than 10 cm above the ledge, then you will have a fast and a furious ride down the river.<br>All of the rapids in the river can be scouted from the bank and secured, except the last one. At one point, about 2/3 down the run, the river goes through a narrow slit, called the Sheep Dipper. This can be portaged by seal launching of the river left bank.<br>Just down stream of the Sheep Dipper starts the last rapid, Der Ban. This is a continuous class IV section, which can be boat scouted, or normally just paddle like crazy. There are not many places to make a rest and rescuing a pinned boat from the gorge takes a big effort. This rapid has no nasty surprises.]]></description>

Shortly after the left turn it makes a sharp (90°) right turn again. After the right turn follow the road a few hundred meters. Before you get into to much woods it is nice to walk towards the river and paddle across it. It is a short hike on the river left side to the last rapid.<br><br>Take out:<br>Just below the bridge.<br><br>Description:<br>A beautiful class III with some nice class IV rapids in it. The river has crystal clear and cold water, very nice to drink. It is easy to boat scout most of the rapids and bank support is also easy. This is an ideal river for a wide range of paddlers, advanced beginners will find it a hand full while experienced paddlers can choose harder lines and play around.This is not a nice place for beginners to take a swim.]]></description>
