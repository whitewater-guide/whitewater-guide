export default `## Grades

We use the classic grade system from I to VI. The grades are always subjective and it’s one of the topics kayakers are always arguing about. We try our best to be as objective as possible but obviously the grade depends a lot on the water level and other factors. Different authors have different opinions sometimes so we always name the authors of each description. 
- **III-IV** The difficulty of the run varies from class III to class IV. It can be class III at low flows and class IV at higher flows. Or it can be just a run with more or less equal amount of class III+ and class IV- obstacles
- **IV (V)** It’s a class IV run with just couple class V obstacles
- **III (IV+, X)** It’s a class III run with one class IV+ rapid and one portage
- **IV (VI)** It’s a class IV run with one class VI rapid. 
- What is class **VI**? It’s a portage that has been successfully paddled.

The description of the whitewater grades on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Scale_of_River_Difficulty) is ok and we agree to it in general.

Examples of class **III**: 
- Sjoa playrun in Norway. 

Examples of class **IV**:
- Amot section on Sjoa river in Norway
- Alpine Sprint section on Sesia in South Tyrol
- Deza classic in Galicia

Examples of class **V**:
- Wellebrucke section on Oetz at medium flow
- Lower Rauma in Norway
- Passer gorge in Italy
- Upper Vez in Portugal.

Important note: rapids tend to change more often than many paddlers believe. Descriptions and grades suggested are always not ideally up to date!

## Water levels

We try to give references for water levels for each section. We use simple terms like **“Low water”**, **“Optimal water”**, **“High water”** and **“Maximum”**. Normally a section losses it’s attractivity and it’s not fun anymore or even impossible to paddle it below Low water. Optimal water level is often not just an average between Low and High. It’s the level when you enjoy this section the most if you have a team that is confident with the difficulty of the run. High water level is the limit for the grade provided. Often you can paddle a section even beyond the High water mark but then the difficulty rises significantly. Maximum is the level when a section becomes unpaddleable. Both Low and Maximum are not historical marks!

The grade we give to a section makes sense only within the limits of low and high water levels provided. If a river is still paddleable outside of these limits but the grade changes we will mention it in the description.

### TODO: color scheme

## Gauges

If available we obtain data from hydro meteo stations (electronic gauges). They are very different from area to area and in many places they don’t exist or their data is unavailable for public. Some of them are updated every 15 minutes and some of them only once a day. Quite often they break and provide no data or false data.

By **“Flow”** we mean amount of cubic meters of water per second (cumecs)

By **“Level”** we mean height of water at certain location (cm)

We prefer to use flow instead of level. The reason for that is that if a gauge breaks you can still get a reference of how much water is there in a river in cumecs while centimeters tell you nothing. Also they might change a gauge and height of water in centimeters will change but they will calibrate it so it shows the real actual flow in cumecs.
