This project is a placeholder for closed/open testing tracks in google play store.

It exists because we used to have open/closed testing tracks, but now they are disabled. We may reopen them in the future, but nowdays we distribute testing apk directly.  
However, when a new production release is uploaded into google play, it's automatically (and/or manually) reviewed. Due to bug (?) that exists at the moment, open/closed testing tracks are reviewed too. And sometimes they block production release because google has changed some rules. To avoid such issues and speed up review process in general, this placeholder app without any permissions is uploaded into open/closed testing tracks.
