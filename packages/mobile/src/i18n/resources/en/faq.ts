export default `# Grades

We use the classic grade system from I to VI. The grades are always subjective and it’s one of the topics kayakers are always arguing about. We try our best to be as objective as possible but obviously the grade depends a lot on the water level and other factors. Different authors sometimes have different opinions so we always name the authors of each description.  
- **III-IV** The difficulty of the run varies from class III to class IV. It can be class III at low flows and class IV at higher flows. Or it can be just a run with more or less equal amounts of class III+ and class IV- obstacles
- **IV (V)** It’s a class IV run with just a couple of class V obstacles
- **III (IV+, X)** It’s a class III run with one class IV+ rapid and one portage
- **IV (VI)** It’s a class IV run with one class VI rapid. 
- What is class **VI**? It’s a portage that has been successfully paddled.

The description of the whitewater grades on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Scale_of_River_Difficulty) is ok and we agree to it in general.

Examples of class **III**: 
- Sjoa playrun in Norway. 

Examples of class **IV**:
- Amot section on the Sjoa river in Norway
- Alpine Sprint section on the Sesia in South Tyrol
- Deza classic in Galicia

Examples of class **V**:
- Wellebrucke section on the Oetz at medium-high flow (180-190 cm)
- Lower Rauma in Norway
- Passer Gorge in Italy
- Upper Vez in Portugal.

Important note: rapids tend to change more often than many paddlers believe. Because of this descriptions and grades suggested may not always be up to date. Obviously being completely up to date would be the ideal!

# Water levels

We try to give references for water levels for each section. We use simple terms like **“Low water”**, **“Optimal water”**, **“High water”** and **“Maximum”**. Normally a section loses its attractiveness and it’s just not fun anymore, or it’s even impossible to paddle in, below Low water. The Optimal water level is rarely an average between Low and High. It’s the level when you enjoy this section the most with your team when they are confident with the difficulty of the run. High water level is the limit for the grade provided. Often you can paddle a section even beyond the High water mark but then the difficulty rises significantly. Maximum is the level when a section can’t be paddled. Both Low and Maximum are not historical marks!

The grade we give to a section makes sense only within the limits of the low and high water levels provided. If a river is still runnable outside of these limits but the grade changes we will mention it in the description.

Please contact us at info@whitewater.guide if you want to correct low/optimal/high marks.

# Gauges

If available we obtain data from hydro stations (electronic gauges). They are very different from area to area and in many places they don’t exist or their data is unavailable for the public. Some of them are updated every 15 minutes and some of them only once a day. Quite often they break and provide no data, or false data.

Please contact us at info@whitewater.guide if there is no data or false data from a gauge.

By **“Flow”** we mean the amount of cubic meters of water per second (cumecs)  
By **“Level”** we mean the height of water at certain location (cm, m)

We prefer to use flow instead of level. The reason for that is that if a gauge breaks and you are at the river you can still get an idea of how much water is there in cumecs while centimeters tell you nothing. Also they might change a gauge and the height of water in centimeters will change but they will calibrate it so it shows the real actual flow in cumecs.

# Colors

We use colors as a common way to visualize water levels in the rivers:
- **Unknown**{color=0} - there is no gauge for this section
- **Below minimum**{color=1}
- **Minimum**{color=2}
- **Optimal**{color=3}
- **High water**{color=4} level, maximum for the grade suggested
- **Absolute maximum**{color=5}, not runnable above it

All colors have gradients so it changes slowly from green to red passing through yellow if water level is rising from optimal to high.

# Map of a region

All sections on a region’s map are shown as colored arrows. Colors mean current water levels as described. An arrow starts at the beginning of a run and ends at the end of a run. If parking for a put-in or a take out is not very close to a river we show additional points on the map. They are called "End of road to put-in" and "End of road to take-out" and they are visible only on the map of a section. If there is a long hike to a river we also put in hiking waypoints. You can see these additional points only on the screen of the map of a section.

# Map of a section

On this screen there is only one section shown. There are additional points referring to the section on this screen like alternative put-in's/take out's, portages, hazards, camp-sites and others

# Rating

Rating is probably the most subjective part in the App because, different people have different tastes. On the other hand nobody wants to paddle a river with dirty rapids and nasty portages and miss a classic nice clean run nearby just because they didn’t know it’s nice. So we put stars from 0 to 5. Portages, artificial features, long flats, dirty and dangerous (for the grade) rapids decrease rating. Longer sections with a lot of rapids are better rated than short ones. At the moment scenery doesn’t influence these ratings. All the ratings are given considering optimal water level.

Examples of 5 stars runs:
- Upper Rauma in Norway
- Lower Vent in Austria
- Egua in Italy
- Oitaven in Galicia

# Duration 

Every group has its own speed for descending a river. We believe there is no need to put hours. So we came up with a simple division, as follows:

- laps (repeat as many times as possible)
- twice (normally you will have time to repeat it after the first run)
- day run (a full-day mission)
- overnighter (bring your multiday gear and be ready to spend one night on the river)
- multiday

# Description

We believe there is no need to provide long detailed descriptions of every obstacle on a run. Instead we always try to point out the key features like the possibility to scout and/or portage all the harder features, how much the run changes with different water levels, if there is anything to know in advance to make the run more fun, less dangerous and portages less exhausting.

Please note that all descriptions of class IV sections are made for class IV paddlers and class V sections for class V paddlers. It means that if you are not confident on class V our description won’t be enough to attempt a class V run. We expect that a person reading a description of a class IV-V run is able to perform certain high-skilled moves and make fast decisions without knowing what is coming in advance. It’s also very important to know that in many rivers (in some areas in ALL rivers) rapids might change significantly. A new portage can appear or an old portage can become runnable.
