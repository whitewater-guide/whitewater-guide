Next interesting feature is a 50m tunnel: there is nothing significant in the tunnel itself but a decent exit rapid at the end which you commit to by entering the tunnel. Take this exit rapid roughly centre and then be prepared to hop out on river right to inspect and possibly portage the slot drop that follows it. In higher flows it is a good idea to scout this exit rapid by parking at the bridge over the canal on the way out of Gilwern, walking up the canal towpath for 200m until you can scramble down to the river on the right. From this point all that remains before joining the Usk are a couple of 1.5m weirs.",
    "directions": "Just west of Abergavenny take a small turn off the A465 opposite Gilwern village. 300m up the road there is a small carpark on the right next to the river. Takeout after you've joined the Usk, the first bridge after the confluence is on a small road linking Gilwern back to the A40.",

The occasional bankside mill and the number of weirs give a clue to the industrial past of the area. At lower levels, some parts can be a little ‘scrapey’ but the most notable and enjoyable features are the rapids which occur in several short sections. The best of these is at Smithy Place in Brockholes just after the road bridge which links the A616 and A6024.

For the more sedate, (and those of us who have noticed shopping trolleys in the weir before now, ) it is very easy to cross the footbridge, walk a few metres downstream and put in in the adjacent woodland. Look out for the Herons which often feed here.\nThe take-out is at the confluence with Mag Brook just before Steps Industrial Park to the north of Honley. Take the A6024 from Holmfirth. About half-a-mile after this joins the A616, there is a road to the left which is signposted “Magdale”. On-street parking is available here before the bridge. The take-out is reached via the public footpath which runs along the front of the houses on the Western bank. Get out on the left bank at the junction of the two rivers.\n",

Take out river left about 1km below the Gobbler, keep your eyes peeled for white marker posts on river left.
